&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author’s note: This is a living, breathing article; the first of its kind. I’m no expert economist, but I’m trying to learn, and for this reason, the following article may not be the soundest explanation of the economy. The more I learn about the economy, what it is and how it works, the better I will be able to explain to you, the reader, all of these things. As I feel more comfortable in my understanding, I’ll revisit this article and update it over time. While it may be embarrassing, I will not delete previous editions that may either contain wrong information, interpretations, or takes that are just plain stupid; so readers, please make sure to take caution when reading this, as this article is not the tool of an expert trying to explain this topic, but rather the white board of a student trying to understand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a question: the economy, what is it? Here’s another one: why? And finally, how come so? Does the economy make your head hurt? What would you say if someone asked you to describe the economy? Maybe you’d say “Money!” or “Business.” or “Perhaps the economy is the result of historical and cultural influences among transactions that occur among different agents”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An economy is “the large set of interrelated production and consumption activities that aid in determining how scarce resources are allocated” [1], essentially, the system in which individuals can receive goods and services. In ancient times, a palace economy would mean that the production of a country’s workers would ultimately be regulated by a ruling monarch. You, as an individual, would be at the mercy of your king or queen in regards to receiving resources. The discovery of the New World marked the advent of the global economy, in which goods and services now had to travel across land and oceans. Here we see the first venture capitalist, a term we now associate with Silicon Valley. However, in Medieval Times, these entities invested in literal “ventures” across the Atlantic. The Industrial Revolution of the mid-1700s to early 1800s shifted the economy from subsistence farming to manufacturing. A Scotsman by the name of Adam Smith, the “Father of Economics”, at this time, writes two important books about the economy: “The Theory of Moral Sentiments” and “The Wealth of Nations”. In his writings, Smith established the economy as result of human interest. Products could be sold at a price dictated by the market - supply and demand. Studying the economy would also mean studying the division of labor. This is our modern understanding of the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern economists typically subscribe to the three-sector theory, which divides the economy into points of labor. The primary stage involves raw materials, the secondary stage involves the transformation of that raw material into sellable goods, and the tertiary stage involves the interactions between business and consumer. Your grandfather worked on a wheat farm, your father worked in a bread factory, and now you run Wonder Bread’s Twitter account; that’s the three-sector theory over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other social sciences, the study of the economy, or at least the pursuit of the most efficient, fair, and logical economy, is never settled, with many very intelligent people telling us how to achieve the perfect economy. Friderich August von Hayek and more recently Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago argued that the market itself is self-optimized and produces the best possible outcome for both business and consumer, while John Maynard Keynes argued that it’s the state that should alleviate economic problems, instigate growth, and have a strong control of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s anything to take away from this article, just remember that the economy is the tool in which you can receive your goods and services, just in the same way McDonald’s is the infrastructure in which you receive your chicken nuggets or how Netflix is how you graciously attain access to Better Call Saul. It may be scary or overwhelming to really try understand Economics, but it’s important, because it not only affects corporate CEOs and board members or your cousin who invests in stocks, but you and your family members as well, as aptly stated by the following tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
